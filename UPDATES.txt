* Thanks kirk for suggesting a bunch of changes. I have implemented quite a few - too wordy to describe them here. If you are interested, see the evolt comments that kirk837 has written.
* Added category to events. This impacted the code and query quite abit.
* Added sms and emailing capability. Email alert is straight forward. For sms, you have to add your own code. See cron.php
* Updated admin to include new features. The focus on admin area is still on the functionality. Will work on the look and feel later.
* Made further changes to filenames. Added new css for longdesc file.
* fixed hyperlink jumpiness problem. Removed the use of # as hyperlink.
* Used single quotation instead of double in some places. Not really necessary but good practice.
* Added new tiny calendar template.
* Added new complex calendar template. I attempted to combine different types of calendar together and did some tricks.
* This application is getting quite complicated now. I didn't expect it to evolve till this stage. But... anyway, have fun.

* Made changes to DB. There are different types of link now.
* Implemented full MVC architecture. Well, you can't escape from not using for-loop but at least everything is more organised. That is why rendering calendar can be complicated. At least the view file looks manageable.
* Major rename of file names and re-organised folders.
* Mass cleanup of CSS in demos. Removed redundant CSS.
* Fixed fillArray logic. User can now start the week with anyday.
* Fixed typos and added comments.
* Updated admin area. Fixed simpel bugs. user able to delete images from admin panel. Admin still basic, not intending to make it complicated.
* Added a plain calendar.
* Updated multiple template.
* Still not very happy with the controller... Man, I wanted to stop but my fingers doesn't allow me to!! Have fun guys.
